# Contributing

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to the project, it really wouldn't be here without the community's help.

Please follow a few guidelines when contributing:

* follow the existing style for code, documentation and misc files
* if you're adding a new method / property, document it
* update `CHANGELOG.md` by checking if the latest version is live (a tag and pod exist):
	* if it is, then add a new version, usually incrementing the patch (e.g `3.8.9` -> `3.8.10`)
	* if it isn't, add your changes under the latest version
